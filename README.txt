Dependencies:
------------
Node (to run tests on clientside)
Jasmine (unit testing framework for backend)

Running Tests:
-------------
To run tests for the database/backend components, first clone *all* files including the
node dependencies in the repository (including Jasmine). Then, run the following commands
for each component: 
    * backend: "npm backend-test"
To run tests for prototypes, run the following for each spec file:
   "jasmine filename.spec.js"
   (script to be written soon)
and unit testing output will print to the console.
